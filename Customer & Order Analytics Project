#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January?#
select count(orderID) from BIT_DB.JanSales
where length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?#
select count(orderID) from BIT_DB.JanSales
where Product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.#
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum from BIT_DB.customers
join BIT_DB.FebSales
on BIT_DB.customers.order_id = BIT_DB.FebSales.orderID
where length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?#
select DISTINCT Product, MIN(price) from BIT_DB.JanSales;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?#
SELECT product, sum(price * Quantity) as jan_total_revenue FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
group by product
having jan_total_revenue > 0
order by product desc;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?#
SELECT Product, Quantity, Price, Sum(quantity)*price as total_revenue from BIT_DB.FebSales
where location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?# 
select count(distinct customers.acctnum), avg(quantity*price) from BIT_DB.FebSales
join BIT_DB.customers
on BIT_DB.FebSales.orderID = BIT_DB.customers.order_id
where FebSales.Quantity > 1
